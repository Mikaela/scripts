## scripts

Miscellaneous scripts sorted by language.

I have moved the repository from GitHub due to concerns related to their
relationship with the [ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [Iran](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us). The main
branch used to be called as `gh-pages` so that the scripts were downloadable
through curl/wget.

### Directories

- _bash_ has just normal bash scripts
- _nodejs_ **MIGHT** get some nodejs scripts
- _WeeChat_ is a placeholder and unlikely to get anything.
- _ZNC_ is another placeholder which is unlikely to get anything.
  - note that they are _modules_ with ZNC, but I don't see why I couldn't put
    them here.

_I doubt I am going to write many WeeChat scripts or ZNC modules, so I won't
be making subdirectories for different languages._
