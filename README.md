## scripts

Miscellaneous scripts sorted by language.

This doesn't contain the scripts that are in my gists,
https://gist.github.com/Mikaela

### Directories

* *bash* has just normal bash scripts
* *nodejs* **MIGHT** get some nodejs scripts
* *WeeChat* is a placeholder and unlikely to get anything.
* *ZNC* is another placeholder which is unlikely to get anything.
    * note that they are *modules* with ZNC, but I don't see why I
      couldn't put them here.

*I doubt I am going to write many WeeChat scripts or ZNC modules, so I
 won't be making subdirectories for different languages.*
