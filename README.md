## scripts

Miscellaneous scripts sorted by language.

I have moved the repository from GitHub due to concerns related to
their relationship with the
[ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice) and
[Iran](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us). The main branch
used to be called as `gh-pages` so that the scripts were downloadable
through curl/wget.

### Directories

* *bash* has just normal bash scripts
* *nodejs* **MIGHT** get some nodejs scripts
* *WeeChat* is a placeholder and unlikely to get anything.
* *ZNC* is another placeholder which is unlikely to get anything.
    * note that they are *modules* with ZNC, but I don't see why I
      couldn't put them here.

*I doubt I am going to write many WeeChat scripts or ZNC modules, so I
 won't be making subdirectories for different languages.*
